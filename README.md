- 👋 Hi, I’m @pianoladybarb.  
- My birth certificate says it's time for me to retire, but my heart and head say no.  
- Why else would I be looking at my second major lifetime career?
- 👀 I’m interested in Distance Education, Instructional Design, anything that requires a technical mindset.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what it's like to be my age and applying for jobs!  Technology definitely makes it simpler though.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that require expertise in Instructional Design.  Anywhere in the world that allows me to work remotely.
